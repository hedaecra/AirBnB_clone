### AirBnB Clone

# Description
This team project is part of the Holberton School Full-Stack Software Engineer program. It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

# Description of the command interpreter:
Create objects and translate it to JSON strings that can be stored, readed, and updated from a file.

# Usage
The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell. It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user for input.

| Command| Example|
| ----- | ---- |
| Run the console | ./console.py |
| Quit the console | (hbnb) quit |
| Display the help for a command | (hbnb) help <command> |
| Create an object (prints its id) | (hbnb) create <class> |
| Show an object | (hbnb) show <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.show(<id>) |
| Destroy an object | (hbnb) destroy <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>) |
| Show all objects, or all instances of a class | (hbnb) all or (hbnb) all <class> |
| Update an attribute of an object | (hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>" or (hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>") |

# Models

The folder models contains all the classes used in this project.

| File| Description| Attributes|
